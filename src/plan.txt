Single feature/single reducer. Feature called Button

Your components will be
ConnectSheet
BodyTouches
FaceTouches
Kills
Submit

Under features you'll have
Form.js
formsSlice.js

Form will have the form and button elements. You can import them in each component and specify details within the component about what the button looks like and to which state property it updates. You can also import the slice into each component to take action to update state.

You'll also have App.js, routes.js, store.js, and AppLayout.js under app folder.

You'll have to make it so that ConnectSheet is the only accessible one at first, then once a sheet is successfully linked then the other functionality becomes available.
